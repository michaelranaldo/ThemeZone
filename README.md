My dotfiles and an installer

## Usage
Edit the installer.sh and ensure that you are using the correct config directory. I can't think of any distro where it wouldn't be .config but hey.

Run:

```shell
./install.sh
```

## Editing
If you want to make changes, ensure that any directories you add get added to the array up top.
